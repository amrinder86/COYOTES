// create a function that takes array as parameter
// create a empty variable 
// then iterate through the whole array and stores each word/phrase and compared each word's length to that stored variable
// if the length of that stored word is shorter than the one it got compared to update the stored variable
// Every time the compared word is bigger in length than stored word ..update the stored word..
// print the stored word as it'll be the longest word/phrase in length.
