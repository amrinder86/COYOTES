#pseudocode
# Create a word guessing game that two users can play
# first user provides the word 
  # second user tries to guess it.
# print dashes to screen and multiply it by the length of word that first user provided.
# set the guess limit to length of the word that first user provided

# now when second user starts guessing the word
  # tell the user how many tries they have 
  #second user will provide one letter at a time.
# check to see if that letter is included in word
      # if it is included then take that word and store it 
        # otherwise tell the user try agian it's not included in the word.
        # now if it included check that letter's index and replace it in dashes with the same index.

# once the user guesses the word or runs out of tries do this.
     # if the guessed word matches with provided 
          # write a victory msg and end the game.
      #otherwise
          # tell the second user they lost because they ran out of tries.
            #end the game
